Simlist - Simutrans listing server

simlist.js should be run with a recent version of Node (0.5.4+), logging goes to stdout/stderr. Configuration is via the config.json file (make a copy of config.json.default).

Currently the server can listen on two IP addresses only (e.g. 0.0.0.0 & ::, or two arbitrary addresses). Specify via the listen and listen4 directives in the config file.

Persistent data is saved to a file, you can change where this file is stored via the sync_file config directive.

By default simlist will bind to port 80 on the addresses specified, then drop root privs and run as www-data. You can configure this all via the config file.


Instances

simlist can be run with multiple instances, if you need multiple listings servers. Note that this requires compiled-in support from the game itself and is only really useful to let you run listings servers for both the standard and experimental versions of the game.


Init script

simlist is supplied with an init.d script for use with Debian, move simlist.initd to /etc/init.d/simlist-<instancename>, (e.g. /etc/init.d/simlist-simutrans) and then edit the file to set up paths. If you use the default install locations you won't need to edit the init.d script. The default locations are:

instancename:
simutrans

node:
/usr/local/bin/node
logger:
/usr/bin/logger
simlist:
/var/simlist/simutrans/simlist.js
pidfile:
/var/simlist/simlist-simutrans.pid


Logging

Simlist by default logs to stdout/stderr, the init script will automatically pipe these into an instance of the logger utility which writes them to syslog. You may wish to filter the syslog output into a specific file for easy debugging. The following config line in your syslog config will do this:

:syslogtag, contains, "simlist-simutrans" /var/log/simlist/simlist-simutrans.log
& ~

You'll probably also want to do log rotation, again, add this to your logrotate config:

/var/log/simlist/simlist-simutrans.log{
    size 1M
    missingok
    rotate 10
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    create 644 root adm
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        invoke-rc.d rsyslog reload > /dev/null
    endscript
}
